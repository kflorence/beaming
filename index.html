The rules and solution for each puzzle can be inferred by interaction and visual cues. Both desktop and mobile devices are supported. </p> <div class="buttons flex-center"> <button class="button" id="feedback">Give Feedback</button> <a class="button" href="https://buymeacoffee.com/kflorence" id="support" target="_blank">Give Support</a> </div> <details> <summary>The Basics</summary> <p> The core gameplay involves selecting a hexagonal tile, which will bring up a toolbar at the bottom of the screen that contains <em>actions</em> that can be used to manipulate the items in the puzzle. The solution for each puzzle varies. The requirements for solving a puzzle will be displayed in the upper right corner of the screen. </p> <p> When looking at the toolbar, you will notice there are two sets of icons on the left and right sides. From here on I will refer to the set of icons on the left side as <em>attributes</em> and on the right side as <em>actions</em>. Attributes define behaviors which belong to a tile. They cannot be interacted with, they are strictly informational. Actions define behaviors which belong to the items inside a tile. A tile which contains at least one <em>action</em> or <em>attribute</em> will have a small, hexagonal indicator displayed towards the top of the tile. </p> <p>The <em>actions</em> on the right side of the toolbar can be interacted with in the following ways:</p> <ul> <li> By tapping on them. This will execute the action on the items in the currently selected tile. </li> <li> By pressing and holding them. This will select the action, if it is valid to do so, which allows it to be moved to another, valid tile. Different actions will have different requirements about which tiles they can be moved to. </li> <li> By swiping them (pressing and holding while moving the finger outside the action button). This will toggle the action, if it is valid to do so. This is currently only applicable to the Rotate action, in order to change the direction of rotation. </li> </ul> <p> Some actions utilize a <em>mask</em> which covers invalid tiles (they will appear darkened). While a mask is active, the action can be cancelled by clicking or tapping outside the puzzle area or on the currently selected tile. </p> </details> <details> <summary>Attributes</summary> <p> As previously mentioned in <em>The Basics</em> above, <em>attributes</em> are the icons on the left-hand side of the toolbar at the bottom of the screen. Click or tap on an icon below to learn more about it. </p> <details> <summary><span class="fill material-symbols-outlined" title="Immutable">block</span> - Immutable</summary> <p> The tile, and the items within the tile, cannot be modified in any way. If there are any <em>actions</em> on the tile, they cannot be interacted with either. </p> </details> <details> <summary><span class="fill material-symbols-outlined" title="Locked">lock</span> - Locked</summary> <p> The <em>actions</em> on the right-hand side of the toolbar can be used, but they cannot be selected, and therefore cannot be moved to other tiles. Locked tiles can still receive <em>actions</em> from other tiles, but they will become locked once moved onto a locked tile. </p> </details> </details> <details> <summary>Actions</summary> <p> As previously mentioned in <em>The Basics</em> above, <em>actions</em> are the icons on the right-hand side of the toolbar at the bottom of the screen. Click or tap on an icon below to learn more about it. </p> <details> <summary><span class="fill material-symbols-outlined" title="Toggle">toggle_on</span> - Toggle</summary> <p> Any valid (toggleable) items in the tile will have their state toggled. For example, toggling a <em>terminus</em> item will turn beams on and off. </p> </details> <details> <summary><span class="fill material-symbols-outlined" title="Rotate">rotate_left</span> - Rotate</summary> <p> Any valid (rotatable) items in the tile will be rotated in the direction indicated by the icon (either clockwise or counter-clockwise). </p> </details> <details> <summary><span class="fill material-symbols-outlined" title="Move">drag_pan</span> - Move</summary> <p> Any valid (movable) items in the tile will be moved from the currently selected tile to a valid tile of your choice. This action utilizes a <em>mask</em> for selecting the valid tile. </p> </details> <details> <summary><span class="fill material-symbols-outlined" title="Swap">swap_horiz</span> - Swap</summary> <p> Any valid (movable) items in the currently selected tile will trade places with any valid (movable) items in a valid tile of your choice. This action utilizes a <em>mask</em> for selecting the valid tile. </p> </details> </details> <details id="help"> <summary>Help</summary> <h3>Feedback</h3> <p> If you have a suggestion or encounter any problem, please use the form below to report them. Email address is optional, but you can include it if you want to get a response back. </p> <section id="feedback-container"></section> <h4>Troubleshooting</h4> <p> You might be wondering what all that stuff in the URL is. Each URL parameter is separated by a forward slash (<code>/</code>). The parameter after the hash (<code>#</code>) symbol is the puzzle ID. The parameter after that is the state of the current puzzle, stored base64 encoded and compressed. Both of these parameters are optional and will be automatically updated when you load and interact with the game. In addition to storing state in the URL, which is useful when sharing the state of a puzzle with others, state is also stored locally in your browser's <code>localStorage</code> cache. If for some reason you need to clear cache for a puzzle, you can insert <code>?clearCache=[puzzle ID]</code> in the URL right after the opening forward slash. If you want to clear all cache, omit the <code>=[puzzle ID]</code>, or execute <code>localStorage.clear()</code> in your browser's console. </p> </details> <h3>Thanks!</h3> <p> This game was primarily inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Talos_Principle">The Talos Principle</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witness_(2016_video_game)">The Witness</a>, two highly recommended puzzle games.
