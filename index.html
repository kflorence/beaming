The rules and solution for each puzzle can be inferred by interaction and visual cues. Both desktop and mobile devices are supported. </p> <details> <summary>The Basics</summary> <p> The core gameplay involves selecting a hexagonal tile, which will bring up a toolbar at the bottom of the screen that contains <em>actions</em> that can be used to manipulate the items in the puzzle. The solution for each puzzle varies. The requirements for solving a puzzle will be displayed in the upper right corner of the screen. </p> <p> When looking at the toolbar, you will notice there are two sets of icons on the left and right sides. From here on I will refer to the set of icons on the left side as <em>attributes</em> and on the right side as <em>actions</em>. Attributes define behaviors which belong to a tile. They cannot be interacted with, they are strictly informational. Actions define behaviors which belong to the items inside a tile. They can be interacted with in the following ways: </p> <ul> <li> By clicking on them (or tapping on touch-enabled devices). This will execute the action on the items in the currently selected tile. </li> <li> By clicking and holding on them (or touching and holding on touch-enabled devices). This will select the action, which allows it to be moved to another, valid tile. Different actions will have different requirements about which tiles they can be moved to. </li> </ul> <p> Some actions utilize a <em>mask</em> which covers invalid tiles (they will appear darkened). While a mask is active, the action can be cancelled by clicking or tapping outside the puzzle area or on the currently selected tile. </p> </details> <details> <summary>Attributes</summary> <p> As previously mentioned in <em>The Basics</em> above, <em>attributes</em> are the icons on the left-hand side of the toolbar at the bottom of the screen. Click or tap on an icon below to learn more about it. </p> <details> <summary><span class="fill material-symbols-outlined" title="Immutable">block</span> - Immutable</summary> <p> The tile, and the items within the tile, cannot be modified in any way. If there are any <em>actions</em> on the tile, they cannot be interacted with either. </p> </details> <details> <summary><span class="fill material-symbols-outlined" title="Locked">lock</span> - Locked</summary> <p> The <em>actions</em> on the right-hand side of the toolbar can be used, but they cannot be selected, and therefore cannot be moved to other tiles. Locked tiles can still receive <em>actions</em> from other tiles, but they will become locked once moved onto a locked tile. </p> </details> </details> <details> <summary>Actions</summary> <p> As previously mentioned in <em>The Basics</em> above, <em>actions</em> are the icons on the right-hand side of the toolbar at the bottom of the screen. Click or tap on an icon below to learn more about it. </p> <details> <summary><span class="fill material-symbols-outlined" title="Toggle">toggle_on</span> - Toggle</summary> <p> Any valid (toggleable) items in the tile will have their state toggled. For example, toggling a <em>terminus</em> item will turn beams on and off. </p> </details> <details> <summary><span class="fill material-symbols-outlined" title="Rotate">rotate_left</span> - Rotate</summary> <p> Any valid (rotatable) items in the tile will be rotated in the direction indicated by the icon (either clockwise or counter-clockwise). </p> </details> <details> <summary><span class="fill material-symbols-outlined" title="Move">drag_pan</span> - Move</summary> <p> Any valid (movable) items in the tile will be moved from the currently selected tile to a valid tile of your choice. This action utilizes a <em>mask</em> for selecting the valid tile. </p> </details> <details> <summary><span class="fill material-symbols-outlined" title="Swap">swap_horiz</span> - Swap</summary> <p> Any valid (movable) items in the currently selected tile will trade places with any valid (movable) items in a valid tile of your choice. This action utilizes a <em>mask</em> for selecting the valid tile. </p> </details> </details> <h3>Help</h3> <p> If you think you've found an issue, you can report it on the <a href="https://github.com/kflorence/beaming/issues">issue tracker</a> (requires a <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> account). Note that the state of the currently active puzzle is stored in the URL (<code>.../#/[puzzle-id]/[encoded-state]</code>). You should include the full URL when reporting issues. You can of course also use this URL to share a specific state of a puzzle with others, just be aware not to spoil. If you're just trying to share a specific puzzle but not the state, just exclude the <code>.../[encoded-state]</code> at the end of the URL before sharing. </p> <h4>Troubleshooting</h4> <p> If you just want to get on with puzzle solving after encountering an issue, you can first try refreshing the page. If that doesn't work, you can try clearing the cache for the current puzzle by adding <code>?clearCache=[puzzle-id]</code> right before the hash sign (#) in the URL and pressing enter. Be sure to remove it after the page has re-loaded, otherwise any changes you make to that puzzle will not be stored in the local browser cache. If for some reason you want to clear all cache, you can use <code>?clearCache</code> without the <code>=[puzzle-id]</code>. </p> <h3>Thanks!</h3> <p> This game was primarily inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Talos_Principle">The Talos Principle</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witness_(2016_video_game)">The Witness</a>, two highly recommended puzzle games. Additionally, this game would not have been possible without the <a href="http://paperjs.org/">Paper.js</a> library. </p> <p> If you're enjoying the game, please consider sharing it with others.
