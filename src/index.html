          <em>Beaming</em> is an open source, browser-based puzzle game that involves directing beams through a
          hexagonal grid. The rules and requirements for each puzzle can be inferred by interaction and visual cues. If
          you'd prefer a little more guidance before you get started, you can expand the sections below for more
          information.
        </p>
        <h3>Table of Contents</h3>
        <div class="wrapper">
          <details>
            <summary>The Basics</summary>
            <main>
              <p>
                The core gameplay involves selecting a hexagonal tile and interacting with the toolbar at the bottom of the
                screen that contains <em>actions</em> that can be used to manipulate items in the puzzle, the goal being
                to figure out the solution for the puzzle. When you have successfully solved a puzzle, you will see a
                message indicating as much, as well as a puzzle overlay indicating the tiles that were part of your
                solution.
              </p>
              <h4>Actions and Attributes</h4>
              <p>
                The actions shown in the toolbar at the bottom of the screen are updated based on the currently selected tile.
                Actions which are available to use on any tile will always show up in the toolbar, whereas actions which
                belong to a specific tile, indicated by the corresponding icon within the tile, will only be available
                when that tile is currently selected. You will notice that some tiles also contain <em>attributes</em> which
                can change the way a tile behaves. Actions which are available generally but cannot be applied in the current
                situation, for example because no tile is selected, will still be visible in the toolbar but disabled.
              </p>
              <h4>Solution Requirements</h4>
              <p>
                The solution for each puzzle varies. The requirements for solving a puzzle will be displayed in the
                upper right corner of the screen.
              </p>
              <h4>Interaction</h4>
              <p>
                In general, puzzles can be solved strictly by <strong>tapping</strong>. You tap on a tile to select it, and
                then tap on an action in the toolbar to apply it to that tile. Some actions support additional behaviors,
                which are listed below and expanded upon in the <em>Actions</em> section below:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Masks</strong> - Some actions require the user to select other tiles. The mask is used to restrict which
                  tiles can be chosen by covering the invalid ones. While the mask is active, the action can be cancelled by
                  either tapping on the currently selected tile (displayed with a dashed border), or by tapping outside the
                  puzzle area.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Swiping</strong> - Some actions in the toolbar support swiping, or pressing on the action and then releasing
                  the pointer outside the action, to toggle between states. For example, the <em>Rotate</em> action can be
                  swiped to change the applied direction of rotation.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </main>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Attributes</summary>
            <main>
              <p>
                As mentioned in <em>The Basics</em> above, <strong>attributes change the way a tile behaves</strong> and are
                indicated on a tile by a light gray icon. Click or tap on an icon below to learn more about it.
              </p>
              <details>
                <summary><i class="ph-fill ph-prohibit-inset" title="Immutable">block</i> - Immutable</summary>
                <p>
                  The tile, and the items within the tile, cannot be modified in any way. Any available <em>actions</em> are
                  disabled.
                </p>
              </details>
              <details>
                <summary><i class="ph-fill ph-lock" title="Locked"></i> - Locked</summary>
                <p>
                  The items and modifiers on the tile cannot be added or removed. Any available <em>actions</em> on the
                  tile may still be used.
                </p>
              </details>
              <details>
                <summary><i class="ph-fill ph-sticker" title="Locked"></i> - Sticky Items</summary>
                <p>
                  Any items placed on the tile are stuck to the tile, they cannot be removed. If the item is a
                  <em>collectable</em>, it will be treated as a <em>Sticky Modifier</em> when collected.
                </p>
              </details>
              <details>
                <summary><i class="ph-fill ph-push-pin" title="Locked"></i> - Sticky Modifiers</summary>
                <p>
                  Any <em>actions</em> applied to the tile are stuck to the tile. A maximum of six actions can be added
                  to a single tile, at which point no further actions will be available for that tile.
                </p>
              </details>
            </main>

            <main>
              <p>
                As previously mentioned in <em>The Basics</em> above, <strong>actions manipulate the items within tiles</strong>
                and are indicated by the icons in the toolbar at the bottom of the screen. Click or tap on an icon below to
                learn more about it.
              </p>
              <details>
                <summary><i class="ph-fill ph-toggle-left" title="Toggle"></i> - Toggle</summary>
                <p>
                  Any valid (toggleable) items in the tile will have their state toggled. For example, toggling a
                  <em>terminus</em> item will turn beams on and off.
                </p>
              </details>
              <details>
                <summary><i class="ph-bold ph-arrow-counter-clockwise" title="Rotate"></i> - Rotate</summary>
                <p>
                  Any valid (rotatable) items in the tile will be rotated in the direction indicated by the icon
                  (either clockwise or counter-clockwise). <strong>This action supports <em>swiping</em></strong>, which
                  can be used to change the direction of the applied rotation.
                </p>
              </details>
              <details>
                <summary><i class="ph-bold ph-arrows-out-cardinal" title="Move"></i> - Move</summary>
                <p>
                  Any valid (movable) items in the tile will be moved from the currently selected tile to a valid tile
                  of your choice. <strong>This action utilizes a <em>mask</em></strong> for selecting the valid tile.
                </p>
              </details>
              <details>
                <summary><i class="ph-fill ph-puzzle-piece" title="Puzzle"></i> - Puzzle</summary>
                <p>
                  Using this action will navigate the user to the puzzle it is configured for, which will be listed in
                  a message above the tile. Any puzzles which have been navigated to before will also be available in the
                  dropdown menu in the top toolbar.
                </p>
              </details>
              <details>
                <summary><i class="ph-bold ph-swap" title="Swap"></i> - Swap</summary>
                <p>
                  Any valid (movable) items in the currently selected tile will trade places with any valid (movable)
                  items in a valid tile of your choice. <strong>This action utilizes a <em>mask</em></strong> for selecting the valid tile.
                </p>

            <main>
              <p>
                Items are placed within tiles and generally will have some impact on the behavior of a beam in that tile.
                Items can be manipulated through the use of <em>actions</em>, as described in the section above. Their
                behaviors may also be modified by any <em>attributes</em> applied to the tile. Some items are <em>collectable</em>,
                meaning that when a beam collides with them, they will be converted into an action. Click or tap on an icon
                below to learn more about it.
              </p>
              <details>
                <summary><span class="item" id="svg-filter"></span> - Filter</summary>
                <p>
                  The filter item changes the color of a beam which passes through it by
                  <a href="https://gka.github.io/chroma.js/#chroma-average" target="_blank>">averaging</a> the RBG
                  channels of the beam with the color of the filter. For example, if the beam is blue
                  (<span class="color" title="#0000ff" style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"></span>) and the filter
                  is red (<span class="color" title="#ff0000" style="background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></span>), the
                  result is: <span class="color" title="#0000ff" style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"></span> +
                  <span class="color" title="#ff0000" style="background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></span> =
                  <span class="color" title="#b400b4" style="background-color: rgb(180, 0, 180);"></span>.

              <details>
                <summary><span class="item" id="svg-portal"></span> - Portal</summary>
                <p>
                  The portal item transports a beam that collides with it from one tile to another, retaining the
                  direction of travel the beam had when it entered the portal. In order for a beam to travel through a
                  pair of portals, it must enter and exit from a direction that is not occupied by another beam.
                  <strong>This item will utilize a <em>mask</em></strong> for the user to choose an exit portal if there
                  is more than one valid exit portal location.
                </p>
              </details>
              <details>
                <summary><span class="item" id="svg-portal-directional"></span> - Portal (directional)</summary>
                <p>
                  As with the portal item, a <em>directional</em> portal transports a beam that collides with it from one
                  tile to another. However, unlike a standard portal, the directional portal will change the direction of
                  the beam when it exits to the direction indicated by the arrow attached to the portal.
                  <strong>This item will utilize a <em>mask</em></strong> for the user to choose an exit portal if there
                  is more than one valid exit portal location.
                </p>

              <details>
                <summary><span class="item" id="svg-modifier-puzzle"></span> - Puzzle Piece (collectable)</summary>
                <p>
                  The puzzle item is a <em>collectable</em> that will unlock access to a puzzle when a beam collides with it,
                  converting the item into a puzzle action on collection. This item will always convert to a stuck modifier
                  on collection, regardless of what modifiers are on the tile.

                  The reflector item changes the direction a beam is traveling when it is collided with, producing a
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specular_reflection" target="_blank">specular reflection</a>,
                  or a mirrored reflection angle.

                <p>
                  The terminus item is both the origin of and destination for beams. Each terminus may have up to six
                  openings, one for each direction. Each opening is capable of sending, if toggled on, or receiving, if
                  toggled off, beams in the color indicated by the opening. When a beam enters an available opening of
                  matching color, a <em>connection</em> is formed between the origin and destination terminus. However,
                  if the color of the beam does not match the opening color, a collision will occur.

                As mentioned in <em>The Basics</em> above, <strong>the requirements for solving each puzzle vary</strong>
                and are indicated by the text and icons on the right side of the top toolbar. Generally, solutions will
                require that a user meet one or more threshold requirements. Click or tap on an icon below to learn
                more about it.

                <p>
                  A connection is formed when a beam emitted from one terminus enters an available opening in another terminus
                  of the same color.

                <p>
                  A move is stored any time the user makes a decision, generally in relation to taking an action. Note that
                  some actions may result in multiple moves. For example, if an action causes a beam to enter a portal with
                  multiple potential exit portals, the resulting decision will result in an additional move.
