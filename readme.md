# Beaming

Beaming is an open source, top-down 2D puzzle game where the primary game mechanic involves manipulating light beams through a hexagonal grid in order to solve puzzles. Each puzzle has unique solution requirements, though they generally require forming some number of connections. The beams are manipulated through interaction with items, such as reflectors, filters and portals, and through the use of actions, such as rotate, move, toggle and swap. Furthermore, individual grid cells may include attributes, which can modify the way interactions with the cell function.

The game seeks to teach the rules of each item and action by intuition, through the use of ever-more-complicated puzzles, introducing a few rules at a time and then challenging your understanding of them. The presentation is very minimal, though there is a glossary of items, actions and attributes for those who would prefer to have a little more guidance.

Additionally, the game comes with a built-in puzzle editor, allowing users to create their own puzzles and share them with others.

## Versions

I'm a strong supporter of open source as a means of knowledge sharing, education and user customization, which is why this project is entirely open source. That of course means you can enjoy most of it without having to pay anything. That said, any support is appreciated. Even sharing the game with others is helpful.

### Online Version

A free version of the game is [available online](https://kflorence.github.io/beaming/) which contains most of the basic game functionality. The online version can also be useful for sharing puzzles you've created with people who don't own the game on Steam, and/or for troubleshooting purposes. If you would like to support development of the game outside of Steam, [you can do so here](https://buymeacoffee.com/kflorence).

### Steam Version

A paid version of the game is [available on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4172230/Beaming/). In addition to everything in the online version, this will also include integrations with Steam cloud storage, achievements and Steam Workshop for sharing and playing user generated puzzles.
